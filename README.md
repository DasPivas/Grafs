# Grafs
 
 We find cycles in the undirected graph, squeaking in depth.
 
Input file:
 We have file "in.txt" (File is next to exe)
 example:
6
2 0
1 3 5 0
2 4 0
3 5 6 0
2 4 6 0
4 5 0
// 6- number of vertices
 
Output file:
 If graf have cycles, then we print "N" and first cycles.
 Else we print "A".
  example:
N
2-3-4-5-2
